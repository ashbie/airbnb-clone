- Mongo/PostgreSQL.

## Built By
Ashbie Beenzu Mweemba

```CONSOLE
NOTE

The repository is named 'airbnb-clone' rather than 'Jour-Par-Jour'
 because, at the time of the project's inception, 
its creator, Ashbie B. Mweemba, had not yet decided on the final name.
The placeholder 'airbnb-clone' was used temporarily during development.

Although the project was eventually named 'Jour-Par-Jour' in its live demo,
the repository name on GitHub remains 'airbnb-clone' as a reflection
of its initial stages.
